# Ten to None Data Analysis

vizualization.ipynb shows all of the data analysis and the creation of the composite faces. Each of the composite faces are saved under the "composites" folder. The composite_main.jpg and the composite_woman.jpg in the root folder are the composites of ALL faces in the dataset.

**Note:** This repo does NOT contain the file current_ratings.csv (csv of all 3498 individual ratings), the model I used in the .ipynb file to get landmarks (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat), or the "images" folder with all of the faces from "Ten to None".
